# ðŸš€ GitHub: Help define the future of AI powered software development
GitHub Copilot is used by millions of developers everyday, we are looking for a team that wants to help us envision the next generation of AI powered developer tools.
## ðŸ“„ project description
GitHub Copilot is currently the most widely adopted AI tool for developers, but its impact is primarily limited to developers while they write code. GitHub wants to rethink what's possible for developer tools with AI. In this project we'd like a team to explore what's possible with AI to empower product development teams. This could include, improving product development practices, collaboration with the product team, or new methods for engaging with the open source communityâ€“or maybe something else we havenâ€™t considered yet! 
If youâ€™re interested in doing a capstone that is research focused on complex technical spaces with cutting edge technologies this will be a good project for you. Youâ€™ll be mentored by members of the GitHub research team. We will provide support for participant recruitment and compensation. We can also provide access to GitHub development tools for your project and can help with study logistics if needed. 
We would prefer a team that is research focused on insight discovery or concept evaluation instead of a prototyping focused project. We also prefer a team with members that have software development experience, but it is not mandatory.
