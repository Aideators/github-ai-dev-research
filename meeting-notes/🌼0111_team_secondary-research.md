### Value and Mission
[Miro: Value and Mission Agreement](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLyIwdks=/?share_link_id=842470421172)

### Research on GitHub Products
Please put your research findings here: [Online observation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zDCiu-d0yLQg-1iJyB0-4IXwAc2alCfg17D4SbU0NZs/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
- Some ideas for research areas:
  - Research on Spark
  - Research on Workspace
  - Other GitHub Products
  - Similar Products 

### Online Observation and literature review on the user side
- How People with no or little coding background use AI to build products
- who are the nontraditional users
- what are their experiences like 
- what do they build 
- How do people use Spark/Workspace or similar products, what is their experience like

### Next Step
- Persona Activity (in-class): identify user group
- Competitor Analysis: conduct after deciding on user group
- Ask the Instructor & mentor for an opinion on competitor analysis: is it better for us to focus on development or broader tools?
